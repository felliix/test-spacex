Hello, This is Fuji Masao

## How to visualize the project :
In this test, we need to show all detail info to the user
We can show this by card list or table format, etc
but in landing page, we can't show all detailed data in 1 card or 1 table row
We we need to implement something to show all detailed info
For this, I implemented DetailModal
Also for compare option, I implemented CompareModal
And I implemented skeleton loader too to make more user friendly Ui

## What I will do if I had more time :
First of all, I will implmenet Codegenerator for graphQL-apis and types
Currently it's optional in this test. if this is manatary option, I will provide perfect result. It's no problem for me at all
Also I will make more reusable component and more boilerplate code, ex: title and content component for detail info
And I will make more User friendly UI
About tailwind css, I will make common styles for reused css
ex: text-sm leading-4 lg:text-lg lg:leading-6 font-normal text-neutral-900
I used this line several times, I will fix this if I had more time
And currently I implemented mobile reponsive briefly, I will fix this also
Some simple UI bugs
I will add comments in code so can easily understand code

## where you encountered problems :
I hoped to fetch search data using `OR` because we need to fetch data either by mission or by roket name
But I didn't find this option in current GraphQL
So currently about search result, it doesn't work for endless scrollable or pagination
If I can design backend api also, I will implemented this part

## How to run the project :

- yarn install
- yarn dev

I hope we can meet soon and jump more deep technically
Thanks
